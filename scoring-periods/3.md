## `Scoring Period 3`
### _15/03/21 - 28/03/21_
<br>


#### Announcement
We are happy to announce the third "official" Scoring Period ([Scoring Period #0](/scoring-periods/0.md) was also created in order to recognize existing contributors to the project).

After the overwhelming amount of submissions for [Scoring Period #1](/scoring-periods/1.md), it was a lot more time consuming than anticipated to grade it, causing some grading delays and errors on our end.

We will fix, and update these in the coming days, and start grading the submissions for [Scoring Period #2](/scoring-periods/2.md) in the the 17th of March.

Again, here are some pointers to submitting based on what we learned during grading of Scoring Periods 0 and 1!

1. There is no need to submit your summary before the end of a Scoring Period!
  - It appears lots of people believe that it's a "race", and that you have to submit early and often.
  - A summary should be the report of all your activities during the entire scoring period. In other words, unless you _know_ you will not make any further contributions, wait until the Scoring Period has ended.
  - Starting from this Scoring Period (ie. 3), we will reserve the right to only grade one summary per person per Scoring Period.
    - As this our fault, we will of course not "punish" anyone for this for periods 1 or 2
2. The program is not ending anytime soon!
  - From interactions with the community, we have seen some people be of the impression that this is the one and only time to act in order to get points.
  - In fact, we plan to keep the project running until we are close to mainnet launch which is least 9 months away.
  - If these plans change, we will notify the community in advance.
3. We _do_ have a referral program!
  - This has now been highlighted [here](/README.md#referral-program)
  - Refer your friends, and start earning points when they submit their summaries!
4. We have now made it so that just running a node will give (almost) as many points!
  - Due to the competitiveness for the Validator spots making it hard for new users to get a spot, we needed to allow users to earn points simply for running (a) node(s).
  - In order for us to verify, you need to "report" to our new [Joystream Telemetry](https://telemetry.joystream.org/).
  - More information, and full instructions/requirements, can be found [here](/CONTRIBUTIONS.md#network-integrity)
