#### Announcement
We are happy to announce the second "official" Scoring Period ([Scoring Period #0](/scoring-periods/0.md) was also created in order to recognize existing contributors to the project). With ~6h left of [Scoring Period #1](/scoring-periods/0.md), we have gotten close to 400 submissions (for both rounds combined) already, which we are extremely happy to see! Due to the overwhelming magnitude, we will start grading early, but the results will not be announced before the 4th of March.

Despite what we consider a great success, there has been some misunderstandings along the way. This is mostly due to unclear and missing documentation from our side, which we have not been able to improve and communicate in time. We wish to take this opportunity to clarify some things.
1. There is no need to submit your summary before the end of a Scoring Period!
  - It appears lots of people believe that it's a "race", and that you have to submit early and often.
  - A scoring period should be the summary of all your activities during that timespan. In other words, unless you _know_ you will not make any further actions, wait until the Scoring Period has ended.
  - Starting from Scoring Period 3, we will reserve the right to only grade one summary per person per Scoring Period.
    - As this our fault, we will of course not "punish" anyone for this for periods 1 or 2
2. The program is not ending anytime soon!
  - From interactions with the community, we have seen some people be of the impression that this is the one and only time to act in order to get points.
  - In fact, we plan to keep the project running until we are close to mainnet launch which is least 9 months away.
  - If these plans change, we will notify the community in advance.
3. We _do_ have a referral program!
  - This has now been highlighted [here](/README.md#referral-program)
  - Refer your friends, and start earning points when they submit their summaries!
4. We have now made it so that just running a node will give (almost) as many points!
  - Due to the competitiveness for the Validator spots making it hard for new users to get a spot, we needed to allow users to earn points simply for running (a) node(s).
  - In order for us to verify, you need to "report" to our new [Joystream Telemetry](https://telemetry.joystream.org/).
  - More information, and full instructions/requirements, can be found [here](/CONTRIBUTIONS.md#network-integrity)
