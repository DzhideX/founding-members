#### Announcement
Alongside our first "official" scoring period ([#1](/scoring-periods/1.md)) for the Founding Member Program, we will also be running a special one-off scoring period to compensate existing contributors to the project.

`Intitial Founding Members` (who have already been contacted) will not be able to submit activity summaries as part of Scoring Period #0 as we have already accounted for their previous contributions.

However, if you are not an `Initial Founding Member` but have already made contributions to the project, during the course of Scoring Period #0, simply submit a summary of all of your contributions to the project so far using the instructions [here](../SUBMISSION-GUIDELINES.md) and we will account for this activity with leaderboard points (in the same way as ongoing contributions).


#### Processing Note

We received very few scoring summaries for `Scoring Period #0`, so we don't have any specific comments or recommendations to make.
For `Scoring Period #1`, more than 700 summaries were submitted, so we have a lot more feedback to provide in the [processing note](1.md) associated with that period.
