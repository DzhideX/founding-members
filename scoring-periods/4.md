## `Scoring Period 4`
### _29/03/21 - 11/04/21_
<br>


#### Announcement

On account of the chain split bug on the Babylon testnet, it has been impossible to submit reports for Scoring Period #3, so we would ask for your patience as we work to launch the new and patched Antioch network.

Meanwhile, we are happy to announce that Scoring Period #4 will last from `29/03/21` to `11/04/21`. 

Due to the network failure we are not expecting any substantial contribution activity at the beggining of the round, though once Antioch is launched, you can submit summaries for Scoring Period #3 and earn points for your participation on this new network.

To make sure your summaries are of the best quality, we recommend browsing through our feedback and comments on the previously graded rounds:
- [`Scoring Period #1`](/scoring-periods/1.md)
- [`Scoring Period #2`](/scoring-periods/2.md)


#### Processing Note

_Once we have processed all of the summaries submitted in this period and inducted any new founding members etc., a processing note will be added here with comments and some suggestions for the next scoring period._

_For submitted summaries that are lacking, incomplete or has some errors, we will contact you on keybase to resolve the issue(s)._

_Check the [Founding Member page](https://www.joystream.org/founding-members) on our website, where we will update grading of all rounds this week!_
