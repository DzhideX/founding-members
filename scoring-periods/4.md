## `Scoring Period 4`
### _29/03/21 - 11/04/21_
<br>


#### Announcement

On account of the chain split bug on the Babylon testnet, it has been impossible to submit reports for Scoring Period #3, so we would ask for your patience as we work to launch the new and patched Antioch network.

Meanwhile, we are happy to announce that Scoring Period #4 will last from `29/03/21` to `11/04/21`.

Due to the network failure we are not expecting any substantial contribution activity at the beggining of the round, though once Antioch is launched, you can submit summaries for Scoring Period #3 and earn points for your participation on this new network.

To make sure your summaries are of the best quality, we recommend browsing through our feedback and comments on the previously graded rounds:
- [`Scoring Period #1`](/scoring-periods/1.md)
- [`Scoring Period #2`](/scoring-periods/2.md)
- [`Scoring Period #3`](/scoring-periods/3.md)


#### Processing Note

_On account of the network being down until halfway through this round, most participants were only able to participate effectively for the second half of the Scoring Period. Nonetheless, we were still pleased with the volume and quality of scoring summaries we received and the enthusiasm of participants in getting nodes back up and running and participating on the new Antioch network._

_Unfortunately, there are still some issues which are still causing some problems for some participants. As a result, we would like to invite participants to read our comments for [Round #1](/scoring-periods/1.md), [Round #2](/scoring-periods/2.md) and [Round #3](/scoring-periods/3.md) to get a sense of some of the errors which are still appearing in summaries._

#### Highlights
