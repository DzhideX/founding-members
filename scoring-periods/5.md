## `Scoring Period 5`
### _12/04/21 - 25/04/21_
<br>

#### Announcement

After some significant distruption to [Scoring Period #3](/scoring-periods/3.md) and [Scoring Period #4](/scoring-periods/4.md) on account of the network upgrade from Babylon to Antioch, we are now ready to process your summaries for Period #3 as quickly as possible. After a short grace period to allow people to submit for Period #4, we will also start processing submissions from this round. We appreciate your patience and understanding while the testnet has been offline.

We don't expect to see any significant activity during the end of Period #3 and the start of Period #4, since many qualifying contributions (including bounties and testnet roles) rely on an active testnet in order to be completed.

Now that we have launched Scoring Period #5, lasting from `12/04/21` to `25/04/21`, there should be some great opportunities to earn points, either through creative endeavours, helping us run the testnet by participating in a role, providing support to the community, completing bounties, making tutorials, bug hunting and more...

As always, to make sure your summaries are of the best quality, we recommend browsing through our feedback and comments on the previously graded rounds:
- [`Scoring Period #1`](/scoring-periods/1.md)
- [`Scoring Period #2`](/scoring-periods/2.md)


#### Processing Note

_Once we have processed all of the summaries submitted in this period and inducted any new founding members etc., a processing note will be added here with comments and some suggestions for the next scoring period._

_For submitted summaries that are lacking, incomplete or has some errors, we may contact you on keybase to resolve the issue(s)._
